Just to save people from fustration,
microsoft still host the developer VMs for previous versions of windows.
If you like me suddenly need a windows 10 version of the developer VM one can go to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)
to find working download links.

Also microsoft if you find this and remove the links you owe me an IDOR bug bounty reward or something >:(
