Here on this page I will, in no particular order, be listing various achivements that I am proud of!

## Talks

- Bornhack 2022 Talk : [Blinkenlights, friend or foe: A history of side channel attacks through the ages ](https://media.ccc.de/v/bornhack2022-4204-blinkenlights-friend-o) What is a side channel attack and how does it differ from a regular attack? Why do people keep on inserting random german words when discussing side channel attacks? And why are these kinds of attacks important and how can I avoid them in my own code? This was defintiely an improvement from last years Bornhack talk and was a great deepdive into the history of TEMPEST.


- Bornhack 2021 Talk : [Start your own ISP: A case study into the series of tubes providing you with cat videos](https://media.ccc.de/v/446-start-your-own-isp-or-just-learn-how-an-isp-works) This was the first conference talk I ever gave at the Bornhack 2021 conference, a humourous high level overview of how the internet is structured from the perspective of starting your own ISP, while the content of the talk is not my best work as I was both nervous and had to rush creation of the slides, I am still proud that I got up and held that talk, a great first step!
