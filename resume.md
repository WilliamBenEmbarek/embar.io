Currently I havn't gotten around to importing my resume onto my website. Currently still trying to decide what format I want to use do I just paste the plain PDF, do I setup something fancy with github actions to sync my overleaf version of my resume to here, do I adopt json resume... Oh right im rambling, for now feel free to check out my linkedin over there to the right, it should do for now, otherwise reach out to my mail and I can send it to you!
